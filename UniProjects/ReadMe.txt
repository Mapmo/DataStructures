These are data structures that I was using for my University homeworks(apart from Queue.h):

-Stack.h is an implementation of a stack, using a template class T pointer and having only functions that I needed for my homework

-String.h is an implementation of a string, using a char pointer, some cstring functions and having its own functions to be effectively used in my code

-Queue.h is an implementation of a queue, using left and right borders, very similar to Stack.h, apart from the left border
