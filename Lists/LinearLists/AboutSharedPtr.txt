I implemented my own version of shared_ptr in order to implement a linked list that uses such a shared_ptr instead of a pointer to the next object. However it turned out that after nothing points to the data of the shared_ptr, it calls  its destructor and then it deletes the data, but this way it starts a chain reaction that causes the m_Next of the data to be destroyed too, and then it destroys its own m_Next and so on... Therefore after some hours of experimenting I decided that it was a bad idea and a raw pointer is the best way to go.
