This directory contains some implementations of hash tables that use LinkedList1, to handle collisions:

-HashTableModularDivision is a hash table that can have a key either std::string, or an integer arithmetic type, even though there are some specific cases that can still work(for instance a float or double type can be multiplied by 10 as many times as it needs for it to become an integer type), but these cases will take more time than the actual hash table. The idea of this implementation is to find the modular of the key and insert it in its specific m_Collision cell, where it will be part of a linked list, when it comes to a std::string, however, first all chars in the string are summed and after that they get modulare devided, therefore there will be a specific function that specializes on std::string
