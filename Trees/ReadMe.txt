BinarySearchTree - and implementation of a binary search tree that contains a structure - Branch (i chose a structure, because its only role will be to contain data its only function is swap), Branch contains a pointer to its parent. The purpose of BinarySearchTree is to be a stable parent for my implementation of a red-black tree.

RedBlackTree - an attempt to implement a Red-Black Tree, that ended in failure, even though the insert function is successful, the erase function cannot be done with this implementation, I realised that I need a NULL object in order to implement it, because sometimes the leaves are not black, but double-black and that is a huge problem, in order to fix this I will need a new implementation, where Branch<T> has key int *, that can be nullptr and when the key is nullptr, then the object will be considered as NULL object(a leaf).
